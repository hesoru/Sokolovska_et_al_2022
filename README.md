This is the full code repository for our study. Processing of 16S rRNA sequencing data; feature table/phylogenetic tree generation; taxonomic classification; alpha/beta diversity analysis (excluding adonis/Dunn's testing); and functional potential analysis were done in bash. R was used for metadata filtering/stratifying nutrient intake data; adonis/Dunn's testing; and differential abundance analysis.
